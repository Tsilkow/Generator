# Generator
Procedural generator of an island and its microclimates.
Creates and simluates elevation, temperature, moisture and drainage. From these values it generates mountains, rivers, lakes, swamps and deserts. All this visualized on a hexmap.

Big thanks to [Red Blob](https://www.redblobgames.com/) for excellent articles on hex coordinates and procedural generation.
